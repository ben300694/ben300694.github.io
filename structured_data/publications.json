                "stub": "Recent research on dialogue state tracking (DST) focuses on methods that allow few- and zero-shot transfer to new domains or schemas. However, performance gains heavily depend on aggressive data augmentation and fine-tuning of ever larger language model based architectures. In contrast, general purpose language models, trained on large amounts of diverse data, hold the promise of solving any kind of task without task-specific training. We present preliminary experimental results on the ChatGPT research preview, showing that ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot DST. Despite our findings, we argue that properties inherent to general purpose models limit their ability to replace specialized systems. We further theorize that the in-context learning capabilities of such models will likely become powerful tools to support the development of dedicated and dynamic dialogue state trackers.",

This correspondence, by way of trisections, was recently extended by Abrams, Gay, and Kirby to the case of smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds. We unify these perspectives and generalize this correspondence to the case of links in closed oriented 3-manifolds and links of knotted surfaces in smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds. The algebraic manifestations of these four subfields of low-dimensional topology (3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, knot theory, and knotted surface theory) are all strikingly similar, and this correspondence perhaps elucidates some unique character of low-dimensional topology.",
