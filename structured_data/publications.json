This correspondence, by way of trisections, was recently extended by Abrams, Gay, and Kirby to the case of smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds. We unify these perspectives and generalize this correspondence to the case of links in closed oriented 3-manifolds and links of knotted surfaces in smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds. The algebraic manifestations of these four subfields of low-dimensional topology (3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, knot theory, and knotted surface theory) are all strikingly similar, and this correspondence perhaps elucidates some unique character of low-dimensional topology.",
